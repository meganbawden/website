      <p>&nbsp;Marymere Falls is a popular waterfall located in Olympic National Park in the state of Washington, USA. It is situated near Lake Crescent, a scenic lake known for its crystal-clear waters. The falls are named after Marymere, the wife of a pioneer settler in the area.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To reach Marymere Falls, visitors can embark on a moderate 1.8-mile round-trip hike along a well-maintained trail. The trail winds through a lush, old-growth forest, offering beautiful views of moss-covered trees and ferns. The path crosses over a wooden bridge that spans Barnes Creek before ascending to the waterfall. Marymere Falls cascades down a height of approximately 90 feet (27 meters) in two tiers. The water flows over a rocky cliff, surrounded by vibrant greenery. It's a picturesque sight and a popular spot for nature enthusiasts, hikers, and photographers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The hike to Marymere Falls is generally considered family-friendly and suitable for most skill levels, although caution should be exercised on slippery or uneven sections of the trail. It's recommended to wear appropriate footwear and bring water, especially during the warmer months. Visiting Marymere Falls allows you to experience the natural beauty of Olympic National Park and enjoy the tranquility of the Pacific Northwest forests. Remember to adhere to park regulations, practice Leave No Trace principles, and respect the environment while exploring this stunning waterfall.</p>
      <h3 class="center">Hoh Rainforest</h3>
      <p><img src="images/mosstree.JPG" width="546" height="820" alt=""/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="images/rainforest.jpg" width="625" height="830" alt="">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Hoh Rainforest is a renowned temperate rainforest located within Olympic National Park in Washington state, USA. It is one of the most well-preserved and biologically diverse rainforests in the United States. The Hoh Rainforest is situated on the western side of the Olympic Peninsula, where it receives a significant amount of precipitation from the prevailing winds off the Pacific Ocean. This abundant rainfall, averaging about 140 to 170 inches (3,500 to 4,300 millimeters) per year, contributes to the lush and vibrant ecosystem found in the area.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>What makes the Hoh Rainforest unique is its rich biodiversity. The forest is dominated by towering old-growth trees, including Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and Douglas fir, some of which can reach enormous sizes. The dense canopy formed by these trees creates a shaded and humid environment, fostering the growth of mosses, ferns, and other epiphytes that drape the branches and forest floor. The rainforest is home to a variety of wildlife species, including Roosevelt elk, black bears, cougars, bobcats, and numerous bird species such as the northern spotted owl and marbled murrelet. The Hoh River, which meanders through the rainforest, supports several species of salmon and trout.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Exploring the Hoh Rainforest offers visitors a chance to immerse themselves in a primeval and enchanting landscape. The national park provides several trails for hiking, ranging from short nature walks to longer backcountry treks. The Hall of Mosses Trail and the Spruce Nature Trail are popular choices for experiencing the rainforest's beauty up close. As you walk along these trails, you'll be surrounded by towering trees covered in mosses and ferns, with rays of sunlight filtering through the dense canopy. Remember to be prepared for the rainforest's wet conditions, as it is often damp and receives rainfall throughout the year. It's advisable to bring waterproof clothing, sturdy footwear, and insect repellent.</p>
